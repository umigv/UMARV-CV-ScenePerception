algorithm notes

1. solve this equation for random set of 3 points

x1 y1 1  a    z1
x2 y2 1  b  = z2
x3 y3 1  d    z3

make sure the matrix has full rank

2. calculate the score (sum the metric for all points)

ax + by + d = z

metric = abs(ax + by - z - d)
score of the plane = sum of metric for all points

3. repeat sampling

NOT DOING. point cloud conversion
px = (x-cx)/fx
py = (y-cy)/fy
py = z
